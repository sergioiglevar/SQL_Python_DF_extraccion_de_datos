## Introduction

Welcome to the **Orders Data Extraction and Analysis** project! This project involves extracting data from the "pedidos" (orders) MySQL database, processing it using Python and Pandas, and presenting it in well-structured DataFrames for insightful analysis. Whether you're a data analyst, a developer, or a project manager, this project demonstrates effective data handling and visualization techniques.

## Features

- **Database Interaction**: Connects to a MySQL database to fetch and manipulate order-related data.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes Python and Pandas to create and manage DataFrames for better data representation.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes 15 detailed exercises that cover various aspects of data querying and analysis.
- **Structured Reporting**: Outputs are organized for clarity, facilitating easy interpretation and decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Libraries**:
  - `mysql-connector-python`
  - `pandas`
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python** installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **MySQL Server** set up with access credentials. If you don't have one, you can download MySQL [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).
- **Visual Studio Code** installed. Download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Basic knowledge of SQL and Python.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orders-data-extraction.git
   cd orders-data-extraction
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Libraries**

   Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python pandas
   ```

   *Note: You may need to restart your development environment or terminal to recognize the newly installed packages.*

   To update `pip` to the latest version, execute:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

## Database Connection

To establish a connection between Python and your MySQL database, follow these steps:

1. **Import Required Libraries**

   ```python
   import mysql.connector
   from mysql.connector import Error
   import pandas as pd
   ```

2. **Database Connection Script**

   Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials:

   ```python
   try:
       connection = mysql.connector.connect(
           host='your_host',
           database='pedidos',
           user='your_username',
           password='your_password',
           connection_timeout=180
       )

       if connection.is_connected():
           db_info = connection.get_server_info()
           print(f"Connected to MySQL database... MySQL Server version on {db_info}")

           cursor = connection.cursor()
           connection.commit()

   except Error as e:
       print(f"Error while connecting to MySQL: {e}")
   finally:
       if connection.is_connected():
           cursor.close()
           connection.close()
           print("MySQL connection is closed")
   ```

   **Sample Output:**
   ```
   Connected to MySQL database... MySQL Server version on 8.0.36-28
   MySQL connection is closed
   ```
